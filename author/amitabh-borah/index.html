Doesn't matter if you're riding offroads or onroad, a loose chain is not a good thing. 



Neglecting the maintenance of your adventure motorcycle can lead to tons of problems, from reduced performance, jerking on uneven roads, wear of the sprocket to safety hazards. That's why its important to ensure that you maintain your chain properly and keep the chain slack in check.



Why is it important to check and adjust your adventure motorcycle chain?



Your adventure motorcycle's chain is the most critical component that transfers power from the engine to the rear wheel. 



A motorcycle chain undergoes wear and tear due to factors like dirt, debris, and stress from high-speed rides and rough terrains. Chains are designed to get loose when under stress, after a couple hundred miles of riding this can result in a too loose chain that isn't a good thing.



If an adventure motorcycle chain is too tight it will result in lots of wear of the sockets and sometimes a snapped chain, and if its too loose then you'll get jerks while riding slowly and abnormal sounds while riding on rough terrain. 



That's why its important to have the chain slack of your motorcycle in the recommended level set by your manufacturer.



How often should you check and adjust your adventure motorcycle chain?



To maintain the optimal level of chain slack for proper performance and safety, it's advised to check your adventure motorcycle chain slack every 500-600 miles. 



If you're thinking why so frequently? It's because a happy chain equals to a happy ride and a happy rider.  However, the frequency of adjusting and checking your chain slack may also depend upon on your riding style, the terrains you ride on, and the manufacturer's recommendations on the optimal level of slack. 



Most adventure riders generally ride 70% onroad and 30% offroads, the chain slack gets effected most when you ride too much on offroads as the speed is not constant and you're always pushing the motorcycle with sudden accelerations.



So 500-600 miles is a good approximate for chain inspection, however if you mostly ride onroad in highways then a flat 1000 miles is recommended as typically the tension on chain is less on onroad.



Just remember to have regular interval chain inspection after those miles are done, this can help you catch any issues early and prevent potential breakdown on the road.



How to know if chain slack is too much on my adventure motorcycle



The easiest way to detect if your adventure motorcycle have too much chain slack is riding on bad patches of roads or offroads, if the chain is touching the chain slider of the motorcycle too much and making sound due to it slapping the motorcycle body then your chain is too loose.



You can also ask someone else to see the chain when you ride, if the chain is going up and down too much during acceleration and on offroads then the chain has too much slack and needs adjusting asap.



There are also a couple of things you can look for that can indicate your chain is loose. Some of the common indicators are:




Unusual Sounds: A loose chain will produce a slapping or rattling noise as it moves along the sprockets. If you hear unusual sounds that seem to be coming from the area around the chain and sprockets, it means that your chain loose.



Vibrations: A very loose chain can cause vibrations that are more noticeable than your usual ones, especially at certain speeds. If you feel like the vibrations through the footpegs, handlebars, or seat, have increased it might be that your chain needs adjustment.



Inconsistent Power Delivery: Like mentioned before, a chain with too much slack effects the power transfer from the engine to the rear wheel too much. You will notice delays or inconsistency in power delivery, mostly during sudden acceleration. This can feel like a lag of the throttle response, plus you'll also notice the unusual sound I talked about earlier.



Visual Observation while Riding: If you look at your chain while riding, you may notice lots of movement of the chain, the chain going up and down too much which is more than usual.




If you think or feel that your chain is loose based on these signs, get it checked asap, down below I have given the steps to how you can check and measure your motorcycle chain slack yourself, you can also alternatively take it to a local motorcycle mechanic. 



Measuring &amp; adjusting your adventure motorcycle chain slack



The first step in measuring and adjusting your motorcycle chain will be to measure how much slack does your chain currently have, once you are done with that you can adjust the slack to recommended level.











Measuring the chain slack on your Adventure Motorcycle



To easily measure the chain slack accurately on your adventure motorcycle, follow these steps:



First Park your motorcycle on a flat solid surface and engage the center stand if available, if not you can just keep it in side stand or use an external stand.



Once the motorcycle is ready use a ruler or dedicated chain slack tool to measure the distance between the motorcycle's chain's midpoint and the swingarm, you can easily calculate the mid point using a scale by calculating distance from start of chain on the front sprocket to the back, then take the mid point.



To measure the chain slack calculate the distance from chain's midpoint and the swingarm using the ruler, first push the chain down using your finger a little. Once you know how much distance there is from the chain to swingarm, then push the chain towards the top, towards the swingarm. Then calculate how much the chain moves overall. This will give you the chain slack you currently have.



Now once you know how much your motorcycle's current chain slack is look at your owners manually and see how much is the recommended chain is for your specific model, generally its best to have a little loose chain when it comes to adventure motorcycles for better offroads performance, and keeping the slack at manufacturer recommend level for mostly onroad.



Adjusting the chain slack on your Adventure Motorcycle



Now to adjust the chain slack you'll nee these tools and equipment:




Wrenches or sockets (as per your motorcycle's specifications)



Torque wrench or a Regular Wrench will also work but you'll need to be cautious to not overtight or undertight the bolts.



Rear stand or paddock stand (for ease of access), if you don't have it you can just use the side stand, note that you will need to keep checking if the balance of the chain with wheel is correct frequently.




Adjusting the slack of your adventure motorcycle chain is a delicate maintenance task and you need to follow these steps for a precise and uniform adjustment of the chain other wise the motorcycle will get disbalanced:



Step-by-step process for adjusting chain slack:



Prepare Your Motorcycle: Park your adventure motorcycle on a flat surface, ensuring it is secure on a center stand or paddock stand for stability.



Locate the Adjusters: Locate the chain adjusters on both sides of the swingarm. These are usually bolts or screws that can be turned to adjust the tension of the chain, this is mostly same for all motorcycle brands.



Loosen the Axle Nut: Use an appropriate size wrench or socket to loosen the axle nut, this will allow the rear wheel to move back and forth.



Adjust the Chain Slack: Turn the adjuster bolts or screws evenly on both sides, so the wheel moves backward or forward symmetrically, make sure the wheel isn't tilted more towards any side and is even. Make small adjustments in the slack and check the tension of the chain to prevent over-tightening or leaving the chain too loose.



Check the Alignment &amp; Slack: As you adjust the chain slack, keep an eye on the wheel's alignment. Make sure the wheel remains straight and properly aligned with the swingarm throughout the adjustment process and the chain slack is according to the motorcycle manufacturer recommendation.



Tighten the Axle Nut: Once the chain has been set to the desired tension and alignment, use a torque wrench to tighten the axle nut to the manufacturer's recommended torque otherwise the wheel will get disbalanced if the bolt is not tight enough.



Recheck the Slack: After tightening the axle nut, check the chain slack using a scale to ensure it falls within the specified range, neither too tight nor too loose.



Tips for ensuring precise and uniform adjustment:



Achieving the right chain slack requires attention to detail. Here are some tips to make sure you get a uniform adjustment of your chain:



Make sure to turn the adjuster bolts or screws in small increments to prevent over-tightening or uneven tension on either side of the wheel making sure the wheel remains straight and balanced.



Use a measuring tool or ruler to check that the chain slack is in the the recommended specifications provided by the motorcycle manufacturer.



Keep equal tension on both sides of the motorcycle wheel to keep it aligned with the swingarm, preventing any imbalance that could affect the motorcycle's handling or balance. If necessary, get assistance from a professional mechanic.



Optimal chain slack for different adventure riding scenarios:



The optimal chain slack can vary depending on the type of adventure riding you'll be going through. 




Off-Road Adventures: For off-road riding, slightly looser chain slack is preferred due to the variable uneven terrain and suspension movements, this allows for better shock absorption and smoother power delivery to the wheel.



On-Road Cruising: Keeping the chain within the tighter end is recommended for on-road cruising. This ensures efficient power transfer and stability of the wheel, especially during high-speed rides and long-distance touring on highways.



Loaded Travel: When carrying additional heavy luggage or traveling with extra weight like a pillion, a slightly tighter chain slack might be necessary to compensate for the extra load and maintain a consistent performance and handling.




After a few adjustments and journeys you'll know the best on what chain slack to keep for future rides.



Mistakes to Avoid When Dealing with Adventure Motorcycle Chain Slack



Adventure motorcycle chain is essential for ensuring a safe and enjoyable riding experience. Avoid these common mistakes to keep your chain in optimal condition:



Over-tightening or under-tightening the chain:




Over-tightening: Excessive tightening of the chain can lead to heavy stress on the drivetrain components, including the engine, sprockets, and bearings. This will result in accelerated wear and potential damage, compromising the overall performance and safety of your motorcycle.



Under-tightening: Just like overtightening, leaving the chain too loose can cause it to slap against the sprockets, leading to wear and damage to the chain and sprockets. Also a loose chain can pose a safety risk, as it might unexpectedly come off the sprockets while riding, leading to loss of control and accidents or injury.




That is why always follow the manufacturer's recommended specifications for chain slack and use the appropriate tools for precise and uniform chain adjustments. And also regularly check the tension of your adventure motorcycle chain to maintain the balance between performance, durability, and safety.



Remember, a well-maintained chain is the key to unlocking the full potential of your adventure motorcycle.",

In this post, we will talk about the features, performance, and considerations that make the KTM 390 Adventure a potential choice for beginner motorcycle riders looking to get their first adventure motorcycle or for some their first motorcycle.



Overall if you look at it, the KTM 390 Adventure is a good beginner adventure motorcycle, it has plenty of power, its lightweight, easy to handle and very compact making it fun to ride on offroads and on road easily even by beginners.

Equipped with a 373cc single-cylinder engine, the 390 Adventure offers a balance between power and manageability, an important factor for beginner riders.



However you should definitely not underestimate the power of the KTM 390 adventure, it might sound like its not that powerful of a motorcycle in the spec sheets, but believe me it's very powerful.



Not that powerful like the BMW R1200GS Adventure, but plenty to do a good amount of harm if underestimated.



Basic Specification of KTM 390 Adventure



Before I get into the things that makes the KTM 390 adventure suitable as a beginner motorcycle let's first look at the basic specs of the motorcycle, so you get familiar with the features you get with it and the power figure, technology etc.

Key Considerations for Beginner Riders When Choosing the KTM 390 Adventure



Riding Experience and Skill Level: Before going for the 390 Adventure its important to consider your riding experience and skill level. 



If you are entirely new to motorcycling, it's better to start with a motorcycle that is easy to handle and not very quick to respond on the throttle. The KTM 390 Adventure has a moderate power output and its throttle response is not way too aggressive so it doesn't feel like it will fly to the skies when twisted. 



However, if you have no prior experience with riding motorcycles, you might want to consider starting with a smaller adventure motorcycles like a Royal Enfield Himalayan or a Honda CRF300 Rally to build your skills and confidence before stepping up to the 390 Adventure.



Confidence and Comfort: Beginner riders should feel comfortable and confident on their motorcycle, this is very important to avoid any mishaps. 



KTM 390 Adventure has an upright and comfortable riding position to sit on the bike, reach the handlebars to ensure you feel at ease. Confidence plays a important role when it comes to handling a motorcycle that is tall and big.



Physical Attributes and Size: Physical attributes and size of the rider is important when choosing a motorcycle. The KTM 390 Adventure is a relatively tall motorcycle with a seat height of 33.6 inches that might be too tall for shorter riders to manage comfortably. 



Weight of the motorcycle is also another important factor. New riders may find it easier to handle a lighter motorcycles, so if you have concerns about the KTM 390 Adventure's weight, it's worth exploring lighter alternatives.



Budget Constraints: Not every new rider who is new to motorcycling have tons of money to get an expensive motorcycle, especially beginners. 



The KTM 390 Adventure is priced in the middle range of adventure motorcycles, which is a  good balance between features and affordability. 



However its important to note that you will also need to spend couple hundred more bucks for ongoing costs like insurance, maintenance, motorcycle gear, fuel, and accessories. So make sure your budget can accommodate all these expenses. 



Why choose the KTM 390 Adventure as a Beginner



So should you choose the KTM 390 Adventure as a beginner? The answer is \"YES\", the KTM 390 Adventure offers several advantages for beginner riders, making it a good choice for those who are just starting to ride motorcycles or looking for an easy to handle adventure motorcycle. 



One of the key benefits of this motorcycle is its lightweight design. It's not too heavy, weighing around 379 pounds which is very light compared to other adventure motorcycles in the market, this makes the motorcycle easier to handle even for beginners with less chances of falling over in twists and turns.



This is especially helpful for new riders who are still building their confidence and skills, mainly when it comes to driving the motorcycle on slow speeds in traffic and in U-turns and corners ( Because almost every beginner faces difficulty with this and having a heavy motorcycle isn't that good of a idea, speaking from experience ). With the KTM Adventure 390, whether you're riding in the city or going off-road, the manageable weight makes it easier to maneuver, which can boost the confidence of new riders. 



Lighter bikes are often seen as more forgiving, allowing beginners to focus on learning without feeling overwhelmed.



And with it's amazing versatility, the KTM 390 Adventure is built to handle different types of terrain. It has features like long-travel suspension, a strong frame, and good ground clearance, making it capable of handling various surfaces such as light to mid offroads, highways and paved city roads with ease. 



For beginners interested in adventure riding and exploring unpaved roads or trails, this motorcycle is a perfect balance between comfortable on-road riding and capable off-road performance. It's a great choice for beginners staring out with motorcycles or adventure riding.



KTM 390 Adventure also comes with helpful technology features such as throttle control system that makes it easier to manage power, adjustable traction control for better stability, and different riding modes to suit various situations like offroads or onroad. 



These technological features are useful for new riders, helping them handle the bike more safely, especially in tricky situations such as corners or unpaved roads. 



The anti-lock braking system (ABS) is also another important feature, preventing the wheels from locking up during emergency or sudden breaking, which is very important for riders who are still learning how to brake effectively and thus preventing any mishaps.



Apart from all its functional benefits, the KTM 390 Adventure has a stylish and attractive design. It looks modern, sporty and adventure, and has plenty of power, which appeals to riders of all experience levels, including beginners and experienced riders alike. 



Riding a motorcycle that not only performs well but also looks good can boost a rider's confidence and enthusiasm. It's a bit like feeling proud and happiness of the bike you're learning on, and that can make the learning process more enjoyable and much safer.



Challenges Faced by Beginner Riders with KTM 390 Adventure



Power and Torque: The KTM 390 Adventure, while not too powerful, but has more torque and horsepower ( 43.5 hp and 26.2 lb-ft torque ) than many smaller advs often recommended for beginners like the Royal Enfield Himalayan ( 25 BHP and 25.6 lbs-ft Torque ) or the CRF 300 Rally ( 27.3 hp and 19.6 lb-ft Torque ). We have done a comparison of the CRF 300 Rally and the KTM Adventure 390 in past too.



For beginner riders, this power might pose a challenge, particularly if they're not used to the responsive nature of powerful motorcycles. 



It's important for beginner riders to control the throttle with care, avoiding sudden acceleration that can catch them off guard. Learning to use the throttle gradually and smoothly is a skill for safe riding on the 390 Adventure.



Height and Seat Height: KTM 390 Adventure comes with a relatively tall seat height of 33.6 inches or 850mm, which could be a problem for riders with shorter legs or shorter inseam length. Getting on and off the bike can be a bit tricky for shorter riders, and reaching the ground with both feet planted can be quite tough. 



This can lead to less confidence on offroads due to uneven roads, especially when coming to a stop or maneuvering at low speeds. 



If you're on the shorter side you might go ahead and first go to a motorcycle dealer and test drive the motorcycle first, and if you find it uncomfortable you might need to explore options for lowering the seat height or just go with an alternative motorcycle instead.



Maintenance and Cost of Ownership: For new riders it's important to understand that all motorcycles, including the KTM 390 Adventure, require regular maintenance. Owning and caring for a motorcycle involves expenses beyond the initial purchase price of it. 



Tasks such as oil changes, chain maintenance, and tire replacements are some critical things to do for the bike's longevity and safety. 



Plus as KTM is considered a premium brand, maintenance costs will be a little on the higher side compared to other motorcycle brands. Therefore, beginners should ensure they have good budget for these ongoing maintenance expenses when deciding to own the 390 Adventure.



Learning Curve and Skill: Learning to ride the KTM 390 Adventure, can be a challenging journey at first. Beginners may face difficulties in learning skills like maintaining balance on U-turns, riding through corners, and riding on off-road conditions. 



Investing a little in getting proper training, such as enrolling in a motorcycle safety course or a basic rider course, and practicing in controlled environments will help. It might take a couple of months to year to build enough confidence and skill required to ride an adventure motorcycle like KTM 390 but in the end you'll get used to riding it confidently and easily on all terrains.



Alternative Adventure Motorcycles for Beginner Riders



If you think the KTM 390 Adventure is not currently the right choice for you then here are a few alternatives that you can consider:




Suzuki V-Strom 250: The Suzuki V-Strom 250 offers a comfortable and upright riding position, making it an amazing choice for beginners. With a 248cc engine, it provides enough power for both city commuting and light off-road adventures. Its lower seat height and user-friendly nature makes it an option for riders of all heights and experience levels.



Kawasaki Versys 300-X: The Kawasaki Versys 300-X is designed for adventure touring and is suitable for beginners. It has a 296cc engine and a comfortable riding position and has adjustable suspension and nimble handling.



BMW G 310 GS: BMW's G 310 GS is a compact adventure bike designed for both on-road and light off-road. It has a 313cc engine and a manageable seat height. The bike's high-quality construction and brand reputation make it a solid choice for beginners.




How They Compare to the KTM 390 Adventure



Compared to the KTM 390 Adventure, these alternative adventure motorcycles generally have smaller engine displacements, which means lower power and torque. This can be an advantage for beginners to provide a gentle learning curve. 



They also have have lower seat heights, making them easier to manage for riders with shorter inseams or shorter height. These alternatives provide an easier approach for adventure riding without the same level of power, which can be more suitable for beginner riders.



Conclusion



KTM 390 Adventure is an amazing adventure motorcycle that offers many advantages, including its lightweight nature, versatility, advanced technology, and design. However beginner riders should also consider the factors like power, seat height, and maintenance costs and their riding skills before going for it.",

You need a motorcycle that can handle different terrains, offer comfort on long rides on both terrains, and carry all your gear without weighing you down. The Kawasaki KLR650 is one such motorcycle that promises to deliver on all these fronts and more.



The Kawasaki KLR650 is an adventure motorcycle that's built to withstand the toughest of conditions, it's like the swiss army knife of adventure motorcycles. This motorcycle can take you through dirt, sand, rocks, and mud with ease. 



Kawasaki KLR650 is designed with convenience in mind. It has plenty of storage space which can accommodate all your gear. And its reliable build ensures that it can withstand the wear and tear of rough rides and harsh weather conditions.











In this review, we'll take a closer look at the Kawasaki KLR650 and talk about its design, performance, comfort, and overall value to help you decide if it's the right motorcycle for your off-road adventures.



The price of Kawasaki KLR650



Let's first talk about the price. Now compared to other adventure motorcycles in this segment the Kawasaki KLR650 is much more affordable and cheap compared to them.



The base price of the Kawasaki KLR650 is around $6700 (USD) MSRP without abs. And the fully loaded adventure version with the accessories like engine guard, fog lamps, bars, dc usb sockets etc., cost around $8000 (USD).



Again compared to other mid size adventure motorcycle in the US &amp; globally the Kawasaki KLR650 is still the least expensive. The price is just a little above the small adventure motorcycles like the Kawasaki Versys x-300 and less then the Honda CB 500 X.



Engine



When it comes to the engine of the Kawasaki KLR650 you should not expect a very powerful engine that make you feel like its going to fly on the twist of the throttle.



It features a 652 cc liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine that produces 40 HP and 39 lb-ft of torque.



The Kawasaki KLR650's engine is not that refined and you should not expect to drive it very smoothly at higher speed on twists and turn in paved roads due to its soft suspension. Compared to other adventure motorcycles in this segment the Kawasaki KLR650 is underpowered and a little outdated on some parts.



It still uses the old technology and almost the same engine of the 90s with 5 Speed transmission and with a few design and tech changes to make it suitable for the current standards.



Below are a few basic specs of the Kawasaki KLR650.



Basic Specifications of Kawasaki KLR650

Few specs can differ depending upon the variant of the Kawasaki KLR650. Like the Kawasaki KLR650 S variant comes with a lower seat height compared to the base variant.



Highway &amp; Off-road Performance



Now as you read above that the engine of the Kawasaki KLR650 is a little underpowered, but that doesn't mean you can't drive it on the highways and keep up with your friends that are driving other adventure like ktm's or bmw.



Kawasaki KLR650 on the highways is a very comfortable motorcycle with a upright seating posture + high capacity fuel tank ( 6.1 Gal / 23 Liter ) + plenty of power to smoothly cruise the highways. There are a little bit of vibrations being a single cylinder engine, however the vibrations are not that noticeable and annoying.



The seat padding is also soft for a comfortable ride, but the seat can get your butt numb on long rides. So its best to get it changed with a seat padding of your choice.



On the off-road too the Kawasaki KLR650 isn't that great, its big and top heavy and with the non adjustable front suspension that is very soft it does get a little uncomfortable to ride on the offroads.



You can however adjust the tire pressure and take out a little bit of fuel to make the top less heavy, this makes the motorcycle much better to ride of the offroads. After that you can just take it over anything, it will continue going over anything that you throw at it be it mud, rocks, roots, branches etc.



To be honest, this bike is still decent on both highways and the off-road, with its cheap price point you cant really expect anything more.



Design and features of Kawasaki KLR650



Design of the Kawasaki KLR650 is still like the classic KLR, with a focus on durability and versatility. 



The motorcycle design still haven't changed lot compared to the old KLR from the 90s, it still is a durable and reliable motorcycle that you can take anywhere you want ( Of course with a couple of minor changes ).



With a high ground clearance of 8.3 inches, the Kawasaki KLR650 provides plenty of room for navigating obstacles such as rocks and logs, while the long-travel suspension offers a smooth ride on bumpy terrain ( however this soft suspension can cause issues on big bumps and paved roads while cornering ).



Kawasaki KLR650 is also designed with plenty of storage space, making it an ideal motorcycle for longer adventures. The rear cargo rack and side panniers can take all your gear, including camping equipment, tools, and spare parts. 



The ergonomics are also well thought out, with features such as a comfortable and wide seat, adjustable handlebars, and wind protection. The seat is wide and supportive with a upright seating posture, providing a comfortable ride even on long trips.



When it comes to technology, the Kawasaki KLR650 includes a digital instrument panel that displays speed, fuel level, and other important information,( just the basics that someone needs, keeping it simple and reliable ). It also comes equipped with a skid plate that protects the engine and exhaust system from damage when riding off-road.



Comfort and Convenience of Kawasaki KLR650



The Kawasaki KLR650  is designed with the rider's comfort and convenience in mind. Just like its previous model is built to handle different terrains, and its ergonomic design ensures that riders stay comfortable on extended journeys.



One of the standout features of the Kawasaki KLR650  is its comfortable seat. The seat is wide and supportive, providing a comfortable ride. However as the seat is soft, it can get uncomfortable after a while, so its best to get a custom seat according to your need.



Kawasaki KLR650 also features heated grips, for riders from cold regions to have their hand warm and comfy.



Wind protection is also an important consideration for adventure motorcycles, and the Kawasaki KLR650 doesn't disappoint in this regard. It features a large windscreen that can be adjusted to deflect wind and rain. This windscreen helps to reduce rider fatigue on longer trips on highways, making for a more comfortable ride.



Accessories &amp; Technology



For the Kawasaki KLR650 there are multiple accessories that you can get.



Starting with extra bright led fog lamps for better visibility at night, DC socket and optional USB socket to charge up your phone or to attach any extra accessories, Frame sliders to keep the motorcycle safe in case of a fall, and tank pads for better grips.



You can also get side bases and top boxes for better storage space.



As for technology the Kawasaki KLR650 offers optional ABS ( Anti-lock Braking System ).



Conclusion



Overall i would say that the Kawasaki KLR650 is a motorcycle that is still like the same KLR from the 90s when it was originally designed and made. With a few changes that makes it suitable for current standards.



It is still a very reliable motorcycle with very less technology and design changes from original make from 90s making it hassle-free compared to other adventure motorcycles in the market today. That's the sole reason this motorcycle even if it lacks lots of modern features, even if its a little underpowered, still getting sold and still has a large cult like fanbase.",

Average Adventure Motorcycle Fuel Economy Based on CC



One aspect that potential buyers often wonder about adventure motorcycles is the average fuel economy based on engine displacement (cc). 



The engine displacement refers to the total volume swept by all the pistons inside the cylinders of an engine. 



Adventure motorcycles come in a range of engine sizes, from smaller displacement engines to larger ones. Let's take a closer look at the average fuel economy you can expect based on the cc of the engine.



Below 250cc



Adventure motorcycles with engine displacements below 250cc generally offer excellent fuel efficiency and economy. 



These bikes are known for their nimble handling and agility, making them popular choices for riders who prioritize fuel economy. 



On average, adventure motorcycles below 250cc can deliver around 60-70 miles per gallon (mpg), allowing you to cover long distances on a relatively small amount of fuel. Examples of adventure motorcycles in this category include the Yamaha WR250R, Honda CRF250L and KTM 250 Adventure.











250cc to 500cc



Now engine displacements between 250cc and 500cc strike a balance between fuel efficiency and power. These bikes offer more versatility, allowing riders to tackle both on-road and off-road adventures comfortably. 



Adventure motorcycles between 250cc to 500cc provide around 50-60 mpg. The slightly larger engines may consume a bit more fuel, but they still deliver respectable fuel economy. 



Notable models in this category include the Kawasaki Versys-X 300, Royal Enfield Himalayan, and BMW G 310 GS.











500cc to 800cc



For engine displacements between 500cc and 800cc, they offer a good blend of power and fuel efficiency. These bikes provide ample power for long-distance touring and off-road excursions. 



However, due to the increased engine size, the fuel economy is slightly lower compared to smaller displacement bikes. 



On average, adventure motorcycles in the 500cc to 800cc range can achieve around 40-50 mpg. Some popular models in this category include the Suzuki V-Strom 650, Triumph Tiger 800, and Yamaha Tenere 700.











Above 800cc



Bigger Adventure motorcycles with engine displacements above 800cc often fall into the larger, more powerful category. These bikes are designed for riders who prioritize power, torque, and performance. 



While they may not deliver the same fuel efficiency as their smaller counterparts, advancements in engine technology have improved their fuel efficiency a lot.



Adventure motorcycles with engine sizes above 800cc typically offer around 30-40 mpg. Noteworthy models in this range include the Husqvarna Norden 901, BMW R 1250 GS, KTM 1290 Super Adventure, and Ducati Multistrada 1260.











Now these fuel economy figures are rough estimates and can vary based on individual riding conditions, maintenance, and other factors. The manufacturers often provide official fuel efficiency ratings for their bikes, which can give you a more accurate idea of what to expect in terms of the economy of your motorcycle.
